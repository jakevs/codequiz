<h1>Code Quiz</h1>
<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>This project calls for the developer to create a quiz based on coding. When you click the being button, the clock will start and countdown. Once a question is answered, the next question will appear if it was correct. It will then take the score based on the amount of time left, and it will save the results to local storage.</p>
<h3>Working Details</h3>
<p>I created this so that when the begin button is pressed, the timer will start to decrease. I then had the questions set up so that when you press the correct button it will continue to the next question. If it is incorrect, it will decrease the time by 5 seconds. If the clock gets to zero, it will say Game Over. Once the questions are answered, then a prompt asks for the user intials to get the high score.</p>
